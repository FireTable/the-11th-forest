/**
 * src/lib/phaser-game.ts
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Singleton accessor for the running Phaser.Game + the in-process scene
 * restart helper the editor uses when the user clicks "jump to scene".
 *
 * Why a module-level singleton: `PhaserGame.tsx` is the only place that
 * constructs `new Phaser.Game(...)`, and the editor panel lives in a
 * separate React tree (lazy chunk). A module-level ref is the cheapest
 * bridge — no Context, no Zustand needed.
 *
 * Why in-process restart: the editor needs to feel like a normal level
 * designer tool — pick a scene, the canvas immediately shows it. URL
 * reload would land the user back in Phaser after a flash of blank page,
 * which is jarring. Phaser's `scene.add` is cheap and `init(data)` lets
 * us pass a freshly-resolved scene spec bundle.
